1. Read or listen question carefully. Rephrase what you have understood from atleast.
2. Check linkedin profile of interviewer. Ask HR to share the name.
3. If an assignment was given, go through that assignment and create a story out of it. If you get a chance to talk about assignment which you will, use that chance to create a lasting impression because this is the place where most people wont prepare well. 
4. Find out if specific team is hiring for the role. Then find out some domain knowledge. i.e. If security team at Microsoft is hiring for the role then learn some basic things about how ML is helping in security. Read the JD again. Big companies have sorted it out. Always go through it.   
5. For Probability: Conditioning is a powerful tool for solving problems because it lets us engage in ​wishful thinking: when we encounter a problem that would be made easier if only we knew whether ​E ​happened or not, we can condition on ​
E ​and then on ​Ec, consider these possibilities separately, then combine them using ​LOTP.Another useful strategy in many problems is to condition on the first step of the experiment. The next two examples apply this strategy, which we call first-step analysis. Complete your choices based on your assumption. i.e. monty hall problem, you assume which door you choose and which door has car.
A. condition on what you wish you knew B. condition on the first step  
6. For probability, if number of choices is small then always draw sample space by hand. Solve by probability fundamentals. you dont need formuale. You will be faster and correct as well. i.e. Monty hall problem with 3 door is sample space and common sense problem. Make assumption to complete the sample space. Just draw an exaustive list of all possible outcomes and then compute the probability by counting favourable events.     
7. One is that whenever you have a discrete sample space,in which all of outcomes are equally likely, you should think about using the discrete uniform law, because this law lets you reduce the problem from computing probabilities to just counting outcomes within events.
And the second takeaway is the way we thought about
conditioning.So we talked about one thing, which is that in your conditional world, when you condition, the relative likelihoods of the various outcomes don't change.So in our original universe, all of the outcomes were
equally likely.So in our conditional universe, all of the outcomes
are equally likely.And we saw it was much faster to apply a conditional version
of the discrete uniform law.
8. One important takeaway is that it's important to really
understand a problem and arrive at a concrete and
precise set of assumptions.
So really have a precise problem that you're solving.
And another important takeaway is to think about your final
answer, make sure that that actually makes sense to you,
make sure that you can justify it somehow intuitively.
In that case, you can actually convince yourself that your
answer is actually correct, because sometimes go through a
lot of formulas, and sometimes your formula may have an error
in there somewhere.
But you could take the final answer and ask yourself does
this actually makes sense, intuitively?
That's often a very good check and sometimes you can catch
errors in your calculations that way.
9. sometimes it's helpful to take simpler things and
take things to the extreme and figure out intuitively whether
or not the answer makes sense.
It's useful just to verify whether the numerical answer
that you get in the end is correct.
Does this actually make sense?
It's a useful guide for when you're solving these problems. Think about monty hall and sampling people on buses problem
