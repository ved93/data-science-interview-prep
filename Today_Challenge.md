Q.1 A mixture of 40 litres of milk and water contains 10% water. What q might.How much water should be added so that the water is 20% in the new mixture?  

Q.2 If there are 2 containers having a mixture of milk and water in the ratio of 5:3 and 2:3, in what ratio should the two mixtures be mixed so that the resulting mixtures have the milk and water in the same proportions?  

Q.3 Suppose that “I Love Discrete Math” T-shirts come in five different sizes: S,M,L,XL, and XXL. Each size comes in four colors (white, red, green, and black), except XL, which comes only in red,green, and black, and XXL, which comes only in green and black.What is the minimum number of stores that the campus book store needs to stock to have one of each size and color available?

Q.4 a) How many cards must be selected from a standard
deck of 52 cards to guarantee that at least three cards of the same suit are chosen?
 b) How many must be selected to guarantee that at least three
hearts are selected?

Q.5 Suppose that a cookie shop has four different
kinds of cookies. How many different ways can six
cookies be chosen? 













## Solutions
A.2 Mixture-1: Milk: Water = 5:3 i.e. Milk:Total = 5:8 i.e. a = 5/8
Mixture-2: Milk: Water = 2:3 i.e. Milk:Total = 2:5 i.e. b = 2/5
Resultant mixture: Milk: Water = 1:1 i.e. Milk:Total = 1:2 i.e. c = 1/2
Ratio of Mixture-1:Mixture-2 used = a – c : c – b (Using the formula of alligations)= 5:4

A.3 Draw the tree diagram. 17   
A.4  a) We assume four boxes; one for each suit. Using the
generalized pigeonhole principle, at least one box contains at least
⌈N/4⌉ cards. At least three cards of one suit are selected if ⌈N/4⌉
≥3. The smallest integer N such that ⌈N/4⌉ ≥3 is N
= 2 · 4 + 1 = 9.
 b) A deck contains 13 hearts and 39 cards which are not hearts. So, if we
select 41 cards, we may have 39 cards which are not hearts along with 2
hearts. However, when we select 42 cards, we must have at least three
hearts. (Note that the generalized pigeonhole principle is not used here.)

A.5 C(4+6-1, 6) = C(9,6) = 84.
