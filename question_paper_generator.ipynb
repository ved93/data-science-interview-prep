Note that the random variable corresponding to the time of the landing of the flight is a continuous random variable taking values between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM.\\nThe probability of the flight landing before a certain time is modelled by the cumulative distribution function. The CDF of a uniform distribution is a (a) continuous (b) non decreasing function.\\nNote that the CDF is 0 before 8AM and 1 after 9AM.

You now compute the posterior after looking at 1000 tosses out of which 502 are heads and 498 are tails. Which of the following could be the posterior estimate of p ?\\nA. Lavanya. Before observing the data, we have a uniform prior on p between 0 and 1, which is means if we were to pick a value for p, 0.5 is the most meaningful value. Further a beta(1,1) is a rather uninformative weak prior, which means the posterior is heavily influenced by the 1000 data points and only mildly influenced by the prior.\\nHence, after observing 502 heads and 498 tails, we would expect the posterior estimate (mean of the posterior) to be close to 502/1000. The precise value would be (502+1)/(498+1) which can be rounded off to .502\\nTake a look at the following link for more information : https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-beta-distribution-7391c18031f1\\n',\n",

You model the outcome of a coin toss using the Bernoulli distribution with parameter p (probability of heads also called bias). p has a beta prior beta(1,1) which is similar to a uniform distribution from 0 to 1.
