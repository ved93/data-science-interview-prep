Your theme was unique and well researched. As TMOD, you'll have a good stage time and hence content is king. I have a couple of suggestions that can help you improve your TMOD performance</div><div>1. TMODs job is to introduce the general structure of a toastmasters meeting. This was missing in today's performance.</div><div>2. Attention span of guests speakers would be lessÂ Â so you can template the speaking in this mannerÂ Â </div><div>a. Intro to theme</div><div>b. Structure of Toastmasters Meeting</div><div>c. Introduce GE</div><div>d. Theme related point 1</div><div>e. Prepared speech section with speaker introduction and 1 min silence for feedback at the end of speech</div><div>f. Theme related Point 2</div><div>g. Table topics session </div><div>h.Â Â relate them to evaluation and introduce GE</div><div>i. Post evaluation- Concluding remarks with short summaries of theme point 1 &amp; 2. </div><div>J. Hand over stage to Presiding officerÂ Â </div><div><br/></div><div>Hope this helps</div><div><br/></div><h3>By Prateek</h3><div>-- Talk in points. Tell about structure. Keep in three points.</div><div>-- Point 1 -summary -details</div><div>-- Rhetorical quest and take a pause.</div><div>-- Make it more relateble.</div><div>-- Take at least one relatable example. Challenge- Very relatabls</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><ol><li><div>Funny statement. TTM</div></li><li><div>Examples- give hint</div></li><li><div>Self - 1-2 liners.engage - I think you all agree.</div><div><br/></div></li></ol><div><br/></div><div>Oreo</div><div>Why wala approach</div><div>Gimick wala approach</div><div>Grammerarian Avinash</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><h3>By Siddharth</h3><div>Hi Ved, I loved your TMOD session today, especially how you handled and anchored the meeting only for a small audience... you were very well prepared, and that's the best thing about you,</div><div><br/></div><div>If one thing I can recommend you is to have an interaction with the audience, although I do agree audience was not responsive to your questions, you can point and ask the question, you will atleast get a response and build upon that to create new exciting content ðŸ™‚</div><div>Any, in general, improvement areas you found while I was speaking?</div><div>probably interacting with the audience gives you the pause you need and then react to their ideas and have a comfortable talks with the audience...</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></body></html>
