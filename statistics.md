Q. How can you decide how long to run an experiment? What are some problems with just using a fixed p-value threshold and how do you work around them?

A. There are few ways to answer this question:

1. Keep running your experiment till you get 90%-95% statistical significance.
2. calculate effect size for your experiment using tools like [optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/sample-size-calculator/), [experimentcalculator](https://www.experimentcalculator.com/) 
3. Atleast have 1000 conversions

If we use just fixed p-value threshold, then it might results into p-value hacking. To work around them we can calculate effect size separately.
