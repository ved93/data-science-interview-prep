1. Two sum and its different variants are good for multiple problems.  
2. A quick sort/merge sort have complexity nlogn
3. If an array is sorted then two-pointer sol is good.
4. hash-map is good concepts to look up values
5. Two-pointers method's complexity is O(n)
6. if youn have sorted list/array, think of using 2 pointers method
7. 3 sum can be easily converted to 2 sum. Use these heuristics.
8. Dont forget extreme cases
9. Accessing qa func from a class.Then use self.func
10. If you need to count ways then think of dp and recursion
11. Recursion is weak part. Solve some problems(Fibonacci,Factorial etc) on recursion and read the blog.
12. Revisit Binary search algo and think about use-cases. Two pointer method
13. two sum problem's 2 pointer solution is good. Implement by yourself bcz it has details whihc you tend to ignore if you dont implement gtourself.
14. If you are repeatedly partitioning your data by some factor, timecomplexity is going to be log n. i.e. 
    ```
    for i in range(0,n,step = 2*i):
    ```
    Time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(Logn) if the loop variables is divided / multiplied by a constant amount.
15. There are two ways to use divide and conquer or reducing the problem  
    1. Use of left and right with while loop 
    2. Use recursion
