1. Two sum and its different variants are good for multiple problems.  
2. A quick sort/merge sort have complexity nlogn
3. If an array is sorted then two-pointer sol is good.
4. hash-map is good concepts to look up values
5. Two-pointers method's complexity is O(n)
6. if youn have sorted list/array, think of using 2 pointers method
7. 3 sum can be easily converted to 2 sum. Use these heuristics.
8. Dont forget extreme cases
9.
