#### Tuple
A tuple is a data structure that is an immutable, or unchangeable, ordered sequence of elements. Tuples are similar to lists, but their values can’t be modified. Because of this, when you use tuples in your code, you are conveying to others that you don’t intend for there to be changes to that sequence of values.
The primary way in which tuples are different from lists is that they cannot be modified. This means that items cannot be added to or removed from tuples, and items cannot be replaced within tuples.

#### Defaultdict
defaultdict never raises a KeyError. If a key isn’t present, defaultdict just inserts and returns a placeholder value instead:

#### deque
Python can append to lists in constant time (the length of the list has no effect on the time it takes to append), but inserting at the beginning of a list can be slower—the time it takes increases as the list gets bigger.

In terms of Big O notation, appending to a list is a constant time O(1) operation. Inserting at the beginning of a list, in contrast, is slower with O(n) performance.
