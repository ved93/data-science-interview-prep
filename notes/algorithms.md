## Greedy Algorithm
*Main ingradients*
- Reduction to subproblems: Make a first move, then solve a smaller problem of same kind 
- Safe move: A move is called safe if there is an optimal soln consitent with this first move.
- Most greedy problems requires to calculate minimum/maximum.

*General Strategy*
1. Make a greedy choice
2. Prove that its the safe move
3. Reduce to a subproblem
4. Solve the subproblem 


*Optimization*
1. Assume its sorted
2. Greedy move can be faster after sorting.
